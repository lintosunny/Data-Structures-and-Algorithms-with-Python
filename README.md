# Data Structures and Algorithms with Python

This repository explores fundamental data structures and algorithms implemented in Python. 

## What you'll find here

* Implementations of common data structures like lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
* Code for various algorithms including searching, sorting, traversing, and dynamic programming.
* Examples demonstrating how to use these data structures and algorithms to solve problems.

## Terminology
* Data structure - Is about how data can be stored in different structures.
  * Primitive Data Structure - Basic data structures provided by programming languages to represent single values, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans
  * Abstract Data Structures - Higher-level data structures that are built using primitive data types and provide more complex and specialized operations. Examples are arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
* Algorithm - A step-by-step instruction to solve a given problem or achieve a specific goal., often by searching through and manipulating data structures.
* Time Complexity - A measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run, depending on the amount of data the algorithm is working on.
* Space Complexity - A measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses, depending on the amount of data the algorithm is working on.
* Big O Notation - A mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. Used in this tutorial to describe the time complexity of an algorithm.
* Recursion - A programming technique where a function calls itself.
* Divide and Conquer - A method of solving complex problems by breaking them into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, solving the sub-problems, and combining the solutions. Recursion is often used when using this method in an algorithm.
* Brute Force - A simple and straight forward way an algorithm can work by simply trying all possible solutions and then choosing the best one
